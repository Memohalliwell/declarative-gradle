# Getting Started with Declarative Gradle

In our first [announcement](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle), we announced a new experimental project called Declarative Gradle.
That post introduced our ideas for a developer-first software definition and how we planned to fulfill our vision for a declarative build language for Gradle.

Since then, we've been working hard to create sample projects and add support for Declarative Gradle in Android Studio, IntelliJ and VSCode.

    With each EAP, we would like you to try out what we have built so far.

    Declarative Gradle is **ready** for trying out our provided sample projects for Java, Kotlin and Android applications.

    Declarative Gradle is **not ready** for adoption by plugin authors, build engineers or software engineers.

1. Follow our [setup instructions](./setup.md)
2. Pick one or more of our [samples](./samples.md)
3. Try out the Declarative Gradle [features](./features.md)
4. Provide us [feedback](../feedback.md)
