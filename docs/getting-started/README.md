# Getting Started with Declarative Gradle

In our first [announcement](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle), we announced a new experimental project called Declarative Gradle.
That post introduced our ideas for a developer-first software definition and how we planned to fulfill our vision for a declarative build language for Gradle.

This was followed by the first Early Access Preview release in July 2024, accompanied by the [First Look at Declarative Gradle](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle-first-eap) blog post.
It introduced a configuration model called _Software Types_, a new _Declarative Configuration Language (DCL)_, and demonstrated the potential for tooling improvements and better IDE support.

Since then, we've been working hard on several fronts.
In November 2024, we [announced the second Early Access Preview](./../EAP2.md) of Declarative Gradle.
As part of this second preview, we published several project samples that are ready for feedback.
These include Java, Kotlin, and Android application samples and a port of the popular Now in Android application.

    With the second EAP, we would like you to try out what we have built so far.

    Declarative Gradle is **ready** for trying out our provided sample projects for Java, Kotlin and Android applications.

    Declarative Gradle is **not ready** for adoption by plugin authors, build engineers or software engineers.
