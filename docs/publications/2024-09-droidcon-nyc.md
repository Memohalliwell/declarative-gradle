# Droidcon NYC 2024 - Declarative Gradle on Android

At Droidcon 2024 on Sep 19,
Nelson Osacky and Inaki Villar presented the current status of Declarative Gradle on Android.

## Abstract

Declarative Gradle is a project that targets better isolation of concern and expressing any build clearly and understandably. It is our key initiative towards improving the developer experience and maintainability of Gradle projects. Declarative Gradle will feature first class support for the Android ecosystem including AGP, KGP, and Android Studio integration.

In this presentation, we will discuss the current state of Declarative Gradle for Android development. We will preview the proposed configuration language, examples of Android projects, and integration with Android Studio. We will discuss our future plans and the Declarative Gradle roadmap. We are seeking early feedback from Android software developers.
